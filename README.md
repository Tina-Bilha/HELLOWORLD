Hello worl with express.js
Here are my steps

Express has been installed in the node_modules folder, which is where all our external dependencies are placed. It is also listed now at the bottom of the package.json file under “dependencies”
We’re setting a variable express that refers to the Express package and then instantiating it in another variable called app.
text of “listening on port 3000” and you can open a web browser to http://localhost:3000/.

We’re using Express’s get method to create our route
